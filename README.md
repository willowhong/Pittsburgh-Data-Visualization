# How to play
Press the "Q"/"A" key for showing/hiding the "steps" data. The bigger the blue circle, the greater the number of steps there are in that location.
Press the "W"/"S" key for showing/hiding the "walls" data. The brighter the cyan circle, the higher the wall is in that location.
Press the "E"/"D" key for showing/hiding the "bridges" data. The faster the yellow bar turns, the newer the bridge is in that location.
Press the "R"/"F" key for showing/hiding the "fishfry" data. The purple rectangles indicate the locations for selling fish fries.
Press the "T"/"G"  key for showing/hiding the "hills" data. The more degree the pink fan shape is covering, the steeper the hill is in that location.
